# Machine-Learning-for-Home-Valuation-in-New-Taipei-City

ABSTRACT

Home pricing is varied and complex, but it is important both to buyers and sellers to do it fairly. Models for predictions of home prices and for analyzing feature importance have been created with datasets in other parts of the world. One study [1] created a model that could perform a prediction of home values in London. Another study [2] created a neural network to predict home prices in Merced County, California, United States, and analyzed the statistical significance of features using a significance test. To expand on this research, this paper uses data from homes in Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan to produce various machine learning models that can predict the cost of a home based on prices of surrounding homes and information about those homes. The models are analyzed to understand the relationship between different aspects of a home, such as location, age, etc. in relation to the price of the home, and the importance of each variable.
